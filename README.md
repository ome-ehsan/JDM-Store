# JDM-Store

Welcome to **JDM Store**, a simple web project showcasing car models and a shopping cart functionality. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks are used. 

## Features

- **Car Models Page:** 
  - Displays a selection of Iconic Japanese Domestic Market cars along with their respective prices.
  
- **Cart Page:**
  - Users can add multiple models to the cart.
  - The cart allows for quantity adjustments (increment or decrement).
  - Users can clear the cart or proceed to checkout.

- **Persistent Cart (Session-Based):**
  - Data in the cart is maintained even after refreshing the page, thanks to `sessionStorage`.
  - Once the tab is closed, the stored data is cleared to ensure no unnecessary data is retained.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and content.
- **CSS**: Styling for the webpage.
- **JavaScript (vanilla)**: Implements dynamic cart functionalities and persistence.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the car models page to browse available models and prices.
2. Add any model to your cart.
3. Go to the cart page to view and modify cart contents (increase/decrease quantities, clear the cart, or checkout).
4. Your cart will remain intact upon refreshing, but it will be cleared once you close the tab.
